## Description

---


This is Avatar Uploader component, made as part of Croct Front-End hiring process.

This seemed to be a simple project but was not simple to get the functioality and design working togather.This was my building process: after understanding the requirements and the layout, I started testing Libs to help with the avatar edit and dropzone. 

Decide to use https://yarnpkg.com/package/react-avatar-editor and https://yarnpkg.com/package/dropzone.

Also using material UI to accelerate the building process, and styled-components for detailed components.

My file/components structure is loosely based on the atomic design by Brad Frost. My intention was to separate business logic from style components. This simplifies the logic components and improves maintenance and code reusability, is easy to change inner components without affecting the logic, or change the logic without affecting the inner components.
